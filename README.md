# About

This website is aimed at home brewing enthusiasts.  The owner of the website wishes to share his home brew recipes and home brewing ideas and have a space for other home brewing enthusiasts to be able to make contact and subscribe to his news letter.


# User Experience (UX)

before starting the website I sat down with the owner and discussed what he wanted to see from his website.

Site owners goals
- It needed to be easy to navigate
- It needed a contact or chatroom style section so that he could meet other beer enthusiasts.
- He wanted a section to show some of his recipes.
- He would like a blogging section so that in the future he could add to it when he next brews.

we rated these goals on a scale of 1 to 5 in importance and feasibility

| Goal | Importance | Feasibility |
|---| ---|----|
|Easy to navigate|5|5|
|Chatroom|2|2|
