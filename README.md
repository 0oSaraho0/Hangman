# About

This is an interactive game based on the original style of hangman. I have taken a school theme with  similar to subjects learnt in school.  It is designed as if it is been played on an old school chalk board.  The user picks a subject from the 3 choices at the begining of the game and picks letters to guess a hidden word related to that subject.  Hopefully saving the hangman and guessing the word correctly.  the user has 1o tries to win the game and save the stickman from being hung.


# User Experience (UX)

## Initial Concept

The idea for this game is to create an online version of the pen and paper game hangman.  I have decided to keep to the original theme of hanging the stick man.  Giving it the name 'Old Skool Hangman' I have played on the idea that this is the original 'old school' version.

I have used javascript, CSS and HTML to create this game.

The game is targeted at adults who might rememeber playing hangman at school as a child and want to spend a few minutes of their day taking their mind of other things testing their knowlege guessing words related to subjects taught in school.

The game could be easily addapted with different subject choices by changing the randome words to be guessed.

## Site Goals

- To provide a fun game that is to navigate and intuative to use.
- To be interactive and fun to play.
- To be fully responsive on all devices.
- To provide a choice of subjects for the user to choose from.

## User Goals

The site will be based on the following user needs.

- I want the site to be easy to use.
- I want the game to be chalenging.
- I want the each game to only take a few minutes so I can play over my morning coffee or during a lunch break.
- I want the game to be similar to how i played as a child to gain a feeling of nostalga.

# Wireframes

This time i drew my wireframes out roughly on paper before I started.

## Colour Schemes

I went for a simple colour scheme.  
I wanted the game to look like it was being played on an old blackboard.
I chose 
[#406343](board-colour.png)
because it is the colour of an old chalk board.
for the text colour I chose
[#FAEDF0](text-colour.png)

# Existing bugs
 I noticed that it was possible to input a blank space on the game and it would give give a false value and loose a life.  I tried to fix it by putting a min length of 1 onthe input box but this didn't work.  i will need to look into this further.

 The subject title on the subject screen makes the screen disapear but does not select a subject.  This needs to be sorted but for now i have put hovers over the subjects making them more attractive to click.
